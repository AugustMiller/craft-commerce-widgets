# Commerce Widgets for Craft 3.x

Commerce Widgets is a Craft CMS plugin that gives you insightful dashboard widgets for your Craft Commerce 2 store. 

They help you see a better overview of your stores performance, by viewing abandoned cart statistics, setting yearly or monthly goals/targets and seeing who which customers are buying off you the most.

All these help you to optimise your store and in turn (hopefully) increase your revenue and orders.
